# React Router v6 Nested Route Rendering Issue

This repository demonstrates a bug encountered when using nested routes in React Router v6. The parent route renders correctly, but its child routes fail to render, even with matching URLs.

## Bug Description
The issue is that nested routes defined within a parent route are not rendering properly.  The parent route renders as expected, but the child components are not mounted, despite the URL matching the child route paths.  This appears to happen even with seemingly correct route definitions using `BrowserRouter`, `Routes`, and `Route` components.

## Setup
1. Clone this repository.
2. Run `npm install` to install dependencies.
3. Run `npm start` to start the development server.

Navigate to `/` and you'll see the Home component. Attempting to navigate to nested routes will not render the appropriate components.

## Solution
The solution involves careful inspection of the route hierarchy, potential issues with route path definitions or component rendering logic.  See `bugSolution.js` for a possible fix.  Note that this issue can be caused by several factors, and this is just one possible solution, depending on the specific implementation.
